# Enchanted Rose Innovations
This is the business in which I Develop and License Acolyte under, however this will be an add on to my developer portfolio. [https://hunterbailey.dev](https://hunterbailey.dev).

This application (because it is more than the frontend you see on the website) will house my developer portal (A.K.A a single place to manage all of my projects, licenses, UI Kits, and more business related items.) this will also house my blog and some more details about the roadmap I have for Acolyte and its accompanying projects going forward.

Feel free to browse the source code to see what works under the hood, I will be changing the platform to fit my needs as time goes on and plan on having a published changelog.

## Why Next.js?
I am a Laravel fan and plan to continue to be, however I needed a project to showcase my skillset in other languages and frameworks. "PHP may not get you to hyperspace the fastest, but it will get you there, the same way, everytime" - Mah circa 2022. I have been working with a bunch of JavaScript frameworks and libraries and Next.js is by far the best choice in my mind currently. Between ease of use, easy deployment, and quick ability to ramp up, while it was not easy to make the switch from Laravel to Next.js, I am glad I did. (For this project anyway.)

## Why are you re-using the color pallet and design from your portfolio?
<p>
I like having a consistent brand between a lot of my projects. Acolyte is a project that differs in that and we will discuss that a bit later. You may have noticed the same shield and rose emblem in the background, like the one next to this text.

This is my personal logo and has a great importance to me as my personal brand. It is also the logo that is on the front and back covers of my book. The contrast of the Cyan and the Dark Slate provides a color pallet that in my mind bridges the world of technology and that of fantasy. Again two very big things in my life. I'm an avid gamer and when not programming or exploring my home of Seattle I can be found nose deep in a book or immersed in other worlds via video games. 

Roses have their own language and meaning, in which I put great importance in this. The blue rose is pretty central to my story and way of thinking. So I like to use the logo when and where I can. I'm no graphic designer, and yet I am very proud of how well it came out.

## Acolyte
Okay okay, let's talk about Acolyte now. Originally this application was a request from a friend and an idea literally written on a napkin. They wanted a system that could manage their students, host recorded videos, easily schedule Google Meets for classes, and have a place students could turn in homework. The initial versions were very rough and basic in terms of design. However, I took the idea and ran with it. My story through education has been a rough one and dealing with some of the current monolithic platforms left much to be desired from the student's perspective. 

As time has gone on the capabilities I've wanted to implement for Acolyte have grown and changed and expanded to far more than just a simple CMS/Scheduling tool. Now it's evolved into something much greater than that as a Remote Engagement and Learning Management System as of version 5. If you would like to learn more about Acolyte I encourage you to visit the page on the website for it, and its associated blog posts.
